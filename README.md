![image alt ><](/recorder.gif)

A simple javascript browser application for recording and downloading audio.


### Demo: 
https://faridvatani.github.io/audio-recorder/


### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Download Git") must be installed on your operating system.

> The browser can not read SASS. It reads CSS. Therefore you will need a way to turn the SASS code into CSS code, a process known as transpiling. Therefore For compiling Sass code, you can use the [“Live Sass Compiler”](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass) Extension for Visual Studio Code.
